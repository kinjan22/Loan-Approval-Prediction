# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals based on applicant details such as income, assets, credit score, employment type, and loan amount. Using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), feature engineering, and machine learning models, we identify the key factors affecting loan approvals and build a predictive model.
